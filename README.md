## Getting Started

### Rules

* New fixes, features or other code work is done in separate branches. Please refer to the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch naming rules and
  other rules on contributing to this project.
* Regularily (at leas once a day) ***rebase*** your feature branch onto the master branch. This will make sure, that you're working on the most up-to-date code.
  The chance for merge conflicts is much lower as well.

Detailed documentation and examples TBD soon.
